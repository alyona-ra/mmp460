        <h1>What's The Lottery?</h1>
        <p>
          Housing is considered affordable if it costs less or about one-third of your income.
          Unfortunately a lot of apartments in NYC are a lot more expensive than that! By applying
          to the NYC Housing Lottery you’ll be entered into a database of people that qualify for
          listings of real affordable housing as it becomes available. Those interested in
          affordable housing can find units according to their household size and income level in
          all five boroughs. Rent increases are also regulated over time.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Lottery partners with The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and
          Development (HPD) and Housing Development Corporation (HDC) who own and monitor the
          buildings that are part of the program.
