          OUR <br />
          MISSION
        </h2>
        <p>
          This campaign was created to help those who seek affordable housing find one. We are not
          the Housing Lottery, rather a user guide for it. We want you to learn more about the Lottery and explore the options you have. We believe that registration process and future participation in the Lottery should be as easy as they can.

          THE <br />
          PROBLEM
        </h2>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>
            According to NYTimes, 25 million people applied for 40,000 affordable housing units
            between 2013 and 2020 in NYC. Demand for affordable housing has vastly outpaced supply,
            and fewer new units are being constructed because of construction costs. The units
            available also do not reflect NYC’s household demographics.
          </p>
          <p>
            New York City households are diverse. One third are singles and 27 percent are families
            with children.

          </p>
          <p>
            There is a substantial mismatch between the units available and household size, so that
            there are not enough studio and 1-bedroom units to house smaller households.

          <p>
            Severely rent burdened households are those paying more than 50% of monthly household
            income on gross rent. Households paying so much of their income towards rent are at
            particular risk of housing instability due to the expected wage shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Half of the households in NYC have income less than $50,000, and about two-thirds of
            them have income less than $30,000. Strict testing requirements based on prior earnings
            increase the number of renters at risk of experiencing housing instability. Without
            savings, these households will also be vulnerable to falling behind on rental payments.
